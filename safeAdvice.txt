Safer investments, like bonds, index funds, and low risk stocks are a much slower way of accumulating wealth.
That being said, they are a steady stream of income, with far less potential for losses compared to higher risk investments.
It is important to diversify your portfolio with both high and low risk investments, and lower risk investments are certainly easier to make if you have many financial responsibilities.
Low risk stocks tend to be more well-established companies with long histories of growth.
Food companies such as Coca-Cola, utilities such as Duke Energy, healthcare such as Pfizer are all examples of these.
Dividend stocks, like Microsoft, are another kind of stock that pay a consistent dividend to shareholders.
Arguably the safest option, however, are treasury bonds. Backed by the US Government, these bonds have almost zero risk,as the only potential risk is geopolitical instability.
Company bonds are similar, as their main risk is essentially the company going under or going through a significant loss. 
The downside to these bonds is that they are very long term, often in the range of 10, 20, or 30 years before you receive the payout.
